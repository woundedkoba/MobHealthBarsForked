# MobHealthBarsForked
A Minecraft Plugin Forked from Rooni's MobHealthbars v0.1.5. 

MobHealthBarsForked is a Paper Plugin which shows a healthbar when you're in combat with any living creature, including other players.

Features:                       
When in combat with an enemy, shows a healthbar on the top like you'd see during bosses. This healthbar disappears out of combat or when the target is killed.
The healthbar smoothly flows, giving you feedback about the damage dealt or healing done.

Commands:               
/mobhealthbars reload - Reloads the config file

Permissions:                   
mobhealthbars.admin - Grants permission to use /mobhealthbars

MobHealthBarsForked 0.0.1 was created because the original mod was abandoned and had not been updated since 2017 although it still worked.

Without going into full detail changes include but are not limited to:
- Upgraded to Java 21
- Upgraded to Paper API 1.21-R0.1-SNAPSHOT
- Upgraded to Maven Compiler Plugin 3.13.0
